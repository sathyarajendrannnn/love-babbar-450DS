Mathematical Example of Longest Consecutive Sequence
Let's illustrate the solution to the longest consecutive sequence problem with a mathematical example using the input array nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2].
Step-by-Step Breakdown
Input Array:
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Convert to Set:
We first convert the array into a set to allow for O(1) lookups.
num_set = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}
Initialize Variables:
We initialize longest_streak to 0 to keep track of the maximum length of consecutive sequences found.
Iterate Through the Set:
For each number in num_set, we check if it is the start of a sequence.
Finding the Start of a Sequence:
For num = 1:
Check if 1 - 1 (which is 0) is in the set. It is not, so 1 is the start of a sequence.
Initialize current_num = 1 and current_streak = 1.
Check for 2 (which is 1 + 1): it exists in the set, so increment current_num to 2 and current_streak to 2.
Check for 3: it exists, increment to 3 and current_streak to 3.
Check for 4: it exists, increment to 4 and current_streak to 4.
Check for 5: it does not exist, so we stop here.
Update longest_streak to 4.
For num = 2:
Check if 2 - 1 (which is 1) is in the set. It is, so we skip this number.
For num = 3:
Check if 3 - 1 (which is 2) is in the set. It is, so we skip this number.
For num = 4:
Check if 4 - 1 (which is 3) is in the set. It is, so we skip this number.
For num = 100:
Check if 100 - 1 (which is 99) is in the set. It is not, so 100 is the start of a new sequence.
Initialize current_num = 100 and current_streak = 1.
Check for 101: it does not exist, so we stop here.
Update longest_streak remains 4 since current_streak is 1.
For num = 200:
Check if 200 - 1 (which is 199) is in the set. It is not, so 200 is the start of a new sequence.
Initialize current_num = 200 and current_streak = 1.
Check for 201: it does not exist, so we stop here.
Update longest_streak remains 4.
Final Result:
After iterating through all numbers, the longest consecutive sequence found is of length 4.
