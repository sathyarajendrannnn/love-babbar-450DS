Mathematical Example-------------------------------
Let's consider an example with the following prices over several days:
Prices: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Step-by-Step Calculation:
Day 1: Price = 7
min_price = 7 (updated)
max_profit = 0
Day 2: Price = 1
min_price = 1 (updated)
profit = 1 - 1 = 0
max_profit remains 0.
Day 3: Price = 5
min_price = 1
profit = 5 - 1 = 4
max_profit = 4 (updated).
Day 4: Price = 3
min_price = 1
profit = 3 - 1 = 2
max_profit remains 4.
Day 5: Price = 6
min_price = 1
profit = 6 - 1 = 5
max_profit = 5 (updated).
Day 6: Price = 4
min_price = 1
profit = 4 - 1 = 3
max_profit remains 5.
Final Result: The maximum profit that can be achieved is 5, which occurs when buying at a price of 1 and selling at a price of 6.
