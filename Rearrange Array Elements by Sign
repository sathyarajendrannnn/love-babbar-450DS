Given Input---------------------------------
Suppose we have the following array:
Input: nums = [3, 1, -2, -5, 2, -4]
Step-by-Step Execution
Separate Positive and Negative Integers:
We will create two lists: one for positive integers and one for negative integers.
Positive Integers:
From nums, we extract 3, 1, and 2.
So, positive = [3, 1, 2].
Negative Integers:
From nums, we extract -2, -5, and -4.
So, negative = [-2, -5, -4].
Interleave the Two Lists:
We will now create a new list by alternating between the positive and negative integers, starting with a positive integer.
The interleaving process will look like this:
Start with the first positive integer 3, then take the first negative integer -2.
Next, take the second positive integer 1, then the second negative integer -5.
Finally, take the third positive integer 2, then the third negative integer -4.
This results in the following arrangement:
rearranged = [3, -2, 1, -5, 2, -4].
Final Result
The rearranged array that meets the specified conditions is:
Output: [3, -2, 1, -5, 2, -4]
